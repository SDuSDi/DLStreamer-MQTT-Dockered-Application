# GStreamer Video Test

<!-- If you are here, why? Are you ok? -->
This code is a simple way of trying to search gst in your computer/docker through CMakeLists, start it and see if its working.

This code is not supposed to be of use, it is just a bit of code made for comprobations in my free time.

Thank you for your patience :D

## Usage

If you still wish to run it, follow these commands inside the <em>gstreamer</em> folder.
```
rm -rf build/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
./gstreamer
```
